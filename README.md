### cmann interface simplifies configuration process for nagios users
Cmann stands for Configuration Manager for [**Nagios-Core**](https://nagios.com)<br>
if you ever had experience in using **Nagios** you may know that the configuration part ( hosts / services / switchs . etc ) is most boring / difficult part of using it, the reason is that there is no interface to manage them<br>
i see people giving up using **nagios** because of it's complicated configuration process.<br><br>
the purpose of this web app is to improve **Nagios-Core** interface to be more user-friendly.
